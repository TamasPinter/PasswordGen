# Password Generator

## Description

I decided to test my knowledge on variables and functions as well as some assign functions. Using those I wanted to see if building a random password generator was possible. There are a few customizeable features for the user to select their type of content. The app creates dynamic random passwords for the user based on their preferences. I learned a lot more about function content and proper code structure in my process. Please enjoy!
